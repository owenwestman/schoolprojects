average.py is a program to average numbers

the user can input an amount of numbers to average, and the numbers that are being averaged

the program checks if the user input is valid

variable dictionary:
	amount = amount of numbers to average
	nums = short for numbers, list of numbers that the user inputs
	tval = short for total value, total value to divide
	cval = short for checked value, assigned locally to avoid problems with variable privateness

process order:

get amount to average
assure that amount is a digit
assure that amount is nonzero
loop to append input to a list containing values
	assure that appended input is a float
loop to add values from the list to a final value
divide final value by length of list

further depth of documentation is in the program as comments

Requirements:
Able to reliably average a group of numbers


Testing:
O(n)

using Intel Xeon (2) @ 2.200GHz, program is limited to accepting around 30000 numbers per second
previous measurement errors were due to a spotty ssh connection

no notable performance decreases while doing math

does not accept input that would break the program, meaning it will not break

python puts numbers in scientific notation beyond a certain point, but there's nothing I can do about that
